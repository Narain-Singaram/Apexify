# Apexify To-Do List 

Apexify is a To-Do List web app developed with a fast and modern user interface. It was developed with Python mainly utilizing a module called Streamlit and all the data is stored in rtf (Rich Text Format) file allowing no external databases to be used. I previously used a txt file but I tried to see if I could also store data with a txt file, and it worked. The minute styling changes of the web app was styled with the style.css file.

_Expect some file and folder structure changes in the future_

### <b> ✨ New Download Feature ✨ </b>
